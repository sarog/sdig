Release notes for 0.45

Maintainers have changed, the project moved to SourceForge, and a host of
new features were added (see ChangeLog). In particular, you can now do
parallelized SNMP searches over several devices simultaneously, search
for a MAC address on all switches, and use different IPs (or hostnames)
for SNMP queries and as routing interfaces of ROUTER's.

Tested to work on Linux and Solaris.

Release notes for 0.40

The build system now uses autoconf, so you can do the usual tricks with 
--prefix and --sysconfdir to customize your build.  Be aware that the 
default configuration will look for sdig.conf in /usr/local/etc, while 
previous versions assumed /etc.

DESTDIR is now supported for packaging purposes.

SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 is now printed when available for switches.

nbname has been dropped.  If you still need additional NetBIOS type data, 
write a script to call Samba's nmblookup, then set it as your HOSTINFO 
command.

UCD-SNMP support is essentially gone.  You can probably still make it work 
if you're determined to use the old libraries, but it will require 
renaming a bunch of includes and variable types.

The -m switch to search by MAC addresses works again.
