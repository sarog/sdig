.TH SDIG.CONF 5 "Mon Mar 24 2003" "" "Switch Digger"
.SH NAME
sdig.conf \- Configuration for the Switch Digger

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsdig\fR(8) uses this file to learn about your network's configuration.  
It is essential to proper operation.

.SH SECURITY WARNING

This file will obviously contain a great deal of information about your 
organization's network, including SNMP community strings.  For that 
reason, you should use appropriate permissions so that only authorized 
users may access it.

I recommend creating a new group, then make the file readable by that
group, and place specific users into that group.

This file should not be world-readable.

.SH DIRECTIVES

.IP "ROUTER \fInetwork\fR \fIaddr\fR \fIcommunity\fR \fIdescription\fR \fIrtr_ip\fR"

List a router for the network \fInetwork\fR (CIDR or a.b.c.d/x.x.x.x
format) at IP address \fIaddr\fR using SNMP community \fIcommunity\fR.
The \fIdescription\fR provides some details when generating the output.
Remember to wrap the description in "quotes" if it contains any sort
of whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc).

	ROUTER 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.1 mycommunity "Company core router"

Optional \fIrtr_ip\fR can be used to provide an explicit IP address of the 
routing interface in the target \fInetwork\fR. Otherwise the same \fIaddr\fR 
used for SNMP queries is used as the routing interface address, which may be 
wrong. For example, firewall rules may allow SNMP access to only one IP 
of the router, but ARP lookups usually require specific interfaces within
the target's subnet.

For example, to query the router (\fIrtr_ip\fR) 192.168.2.1 of the 
\fInetwork\fR 192.168.2.0/24 via SNMP interface (\fIaddr\fR) 192.168.3.254 
configure a line like this:

	ROUTER 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.3.254 mycommunity "Company core router" 192.168.2.1

Textual Hostnames can be used for \fIrtr_ip\fR and \fIaddr\fR, subject to
be resolved by system (via /etc/hosts or DNS Resolver).

NOTE: Some switches, namely Cisco Catalyst (IOS), require SNMP queries  
for different VLANs to use different community strings. For example, to 
look up \fImycommunity\fR in VLAN123 you'll need to write
\fImycommunity@123\fR.

.IP "SWITCH \fInetwork\fR \fIaddr\fR \fIcommunity\fR \fIdescription\fR"

Like ROUTER, but for a switch instead. Note there's no equivalent of 
\fIrtr_ip\fR.

	SWITCH 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.2 mycommunity "Upstairs data room"

	SWITCH 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.3 mycommunity "Downstairs data room"

Textual Hostnames can be used for \fIaddr\fR, resolved by system 
(/etc/hosts or DNS Resolver).

NOTE: Some switches, namely Cisco Catalyst (IOS), require SNMP queries  
for different VLANs to use different community strings. For example, to 
look up \fImycommunity\fR in VLAN123 you'll need to write
\fImycommunity@123\fR.

.IP "LINKINFO \fIaddr\fR \fIport num\fR \fIdescription\fR"

Describe a connection between switches so it won't show up on the
normal sdig display.  This limits your findings in normal mode to 
port(s) that probably lead to the target host.  Use verbose mode to
display all of them, even the ones that just go to other switches.

	LINKINFO 192.168.3.2 24 "link to downstairs switch"

	LINKINFO 192.168.3.3 24 "link to upstairs switch"

.IP "PORTDESC \fIaddr\fR \fIport num\fR \fIdescription\fR"

Describe a port in a switch.  Usually used for details like patch panel
numbers and other things that can't be inferred by asking the equipment
directly.

Also useful for downlink ports to either "dumb" active equipment (i.e.
hubs with no SNMP capabilities) or to another network's equipment to
which you have no SNMP-query access (unknown community name).

	PORTDESC 192.168.3.2 1 "Upstairs patch panel #10"

	PORTDESC 192.168.3.3 25 "Fiber to remote site"

	PORTDESC 192.168.3.3 48 "UPLINK to Campus ISP"

.IP "WINS \fIaddr\fR"

Tell nmblookup to use the WINS server at \fIaddr\fR for name
lookups.  Only used when NMBLOOKUP is defined and DNS lookups fail.

	WINS 192.168.100.1

.IP "NMBLOOKUP \fIpath\fR"

Specify the path to Samba's nmblookup binary.  This might be
/usr/local/samba/bin/nmblookup if you do a stock install from source.
This program is optional, and is provided to augment DNS lookups in
environments laden with Windows machines.

	NMBLOOKUP /usr/local/samba/bin/nmblookup

.IP "MACTABLE \fIpath\fR"

Specify the location of the MAC table file.  This is another item that is
used to provide a few more bits of information when tracking down a
system.  You might use it to find rogue NICs that are not the
company-approved brand.

This file is rather large and rarely changes, so it's not included in the
source distribution.  You can get it on the main sdig web site -
http://www.exploits.org/sdig/

	MACTABLE /etc/mactable

.IP "HOSTINFO \fIpath\fR"
 
Give the location of a script or program that will be called shortly
after displaying the Query: data.  It will receive the IP address of
the target host as an argument.

If you want to display things like the system's NetBIOS name, this is   
a good place to put a call to Samba's nmblookup.
