TODO list
=========

Things that need to happen sooner or later...

 - Other portability changes

   If sdig doesn't work properly on your favorite OS, it's probably 
   because I don't run it here.  Mail me and we'll make it work.
   If I can make UPS software run everywhere, then something as simple
   as this shouldn't be that hard.


 - Use remaining system.* information to enhance the output:

   system.sysDescr.0
   system.sysLocation.0
   system.sysContact.0

Then there are the blue sky items, such as:

 - perhaps some kind of database plugin functionality

 - -m <MAC> should have a way to go through all of the routers in 
   the config file if you really have no idea where a host is
 ++ (done in 0.45 for going through all SWITCHes, regardless of IP/subnet)
 -- also going through ROUTERs is a nifty idea, see also below

 - While doing MAC-based searches, it should also hit the routers and
   try to reverse it back to IP address(es) for extra tracking help
 -- ...and fetch VLAN IDs which contain the MAC (may be many)
 -- and check all of the router's tables, not just those configured
   according to subnets

 - include snmpwalk of a router (IP-MIB::ipAdEntNetMask probably) to get
   its routing interface IPs and netmasks and automatically derive the
   interfaces for lookup

 - for extra confirmation, i.e. when other methods failed, try looking up
   the switches' ARP tables; some switches have them.

 - include ping so that routers/switches would cache the needed IP/MAC.
   This quest also needs autoconf detector of capabilities for portability.

 - include lookups of local host's ARP table, bypassing SNMP (i.e. good
   for a management station with links to many/all subnets).
   This quest also needs autoconf detector of capabilities for portability.
   Work in progress postponed for sdig-0.46.

 - add a flag to limit number of spawned child processes for parallelized
   queries.
